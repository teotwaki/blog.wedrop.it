Nigh on [a decade ago][old-coat], I switched from Pelican to Jekyll as my
blog's engine. Over the past couple of days, I decided to update the blog engine again with the hope
that it might get me to write (publicly) again.

I haven't published in a long time. My last post was written at the request of a friend who asked me
to share a childhood memory. And that was in 2019! I think it's high time to actually start writing
more things that I can share. Every time I've written this kind of post, I've promised writing about
technical things. This time around, however, I feel like maybe it's time for me to release some
different words.

If everything goes to plan, tomorrow should see the arrival of my new keyboard. I decided to dive
into the world of custom mechanical ergonomic split keyboards, and this one only has 36 keys! I'll
see how long it takes me to write an article using it, and maybe that can be a good motivator in
learning how to type with that keyboard.

Over the past few years, I've noticed that while my typing speed is still quite high (I can still
easily hit 100 wpm), the quality of my typing is decreased massively. I somehow switched to using my
right index to hit the space key, and my right hand is moving *all over the place* in order to hit
many, many keys. As someone who spends many hours on keyboards every day, I'd like to protect myself
from future injuries caused by poor typing hygiene. This mostly happens when I'm using my laptop,
however I've started noticing it also when I'm using my full-size keyboard.

I also decided to cull some old articles. The main reason is that they either said things I
don't necessarily agree with anymore, or said it in a way that is maybe not as tactful as I would
express those opinions today. As an example, I used to have an article that said I don't enjoy
managing. But I wrote that article well over a decade ago, and it was mostly during a spat with my
then-manager. And the truth is, I love managing. I love creating and running teams. So why would I
keep words that don't reflect how I feel today?
