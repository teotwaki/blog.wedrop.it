It’s a great article, and I highly recommend it.<p>At one point, Steve mentions that he’s not a big fan of the “choose the right tool for the job” trope that we hear very often in software engineering circles:<blockquote><p>There’s some sort of balance here to be struck. But at the same time, I hate “choose the right tool for the job” as a suggestion. Other than art projects, has anyone ever deliberately chosen the wrong tool? Often, something that seems like the wrong tool is chosen simply because the contextual requirements weren’t obvious to you, the interlocutor.</blockquote><p>I’m not entirely certain how broad the definition of “contextual requirements” is, but provided it does not include laziness, I believe that there are many examples where people have chosen the wrong tool for the job, deliberately.<p>I, myself, am the first one to be guilty of this. And I’m almost entirely convinced that <em>you</em> are, too. Growing up, I had a decent collection of pocket knives, and would always have one with me when I was roaming the countryside. My pocket knife was a pry bar, a screw driver, a bottle opener, a coal rake, a skewer, a windlass, and a toothpick.<p>Furthermore, how many of us used our tongues to see if a 9V battery still had a charge in it or not? I still readily reach for a butter knife when I need to unscrew a flathead screw without opening my toolbox. How many PMs have used Visio or PowerPoint as a project management tool? How many build systems started out as “a quick shell script”? How many businesses have <em>critical</em> Excel documents as the source of truth, or even as an entire database?<p>In some cases, one might argue that these choices were made out of necessity. Maybe that’s the <em>contextual requirement</em> factor Steve mentions. Is it really, though? One of the most well-known <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454>StackOverflow answers</a> documents why one should never use regexes to try and parse HTML. It is perhaps one of the best examples of Maslow’s hammer that we have for software development. No matter how many warnings, no matter how complex the grammar, once people grasp the basics of regular expressions they believe they can parse anything with them. After years of that answer being published, and legions of regex aficionados “Yes, but…”’ing him, the author gave up:<blockquote><p>I think it’s time for me to quit the post of Assistant Don’t Parse HTML With Regex Officer. No matter how many times we say it, they won’t stop coming every day… every hour even. It is a lost cause, which someone else can fight for a bit. So go on, parse HTML with regex, if you must. It’s only broken code, not life and death.</blockquote><p>So, why would someone deliberately choose the wrong tool? Laziness is, I think, a big factor. Ignorance and desperation are other reasons I could trivially understand. Steve gives art a free pass—and he’s right. Sometimes, using the explicitly wrong tool makes a statement or teaches a lesson.<p>By “contextual requirements”, Steve likely meant that in some cases, a project might adopt a choice that could be considered objectively inferior by externals, while still being the “correct” choice for that specific team, given the constraints they are facing. And in a way, the same charity could be extended to me using my pen knife as a pry bar to open a can of paint: there was no good alternative immediately available, therefore it was the right choice, because the alternative would have been to not do something. As Teddy Roosevelt put it, “the next best thing is the <em>wrong</em> thing”.<p>There is a trait in toxic management to try and give everything a positive spin, and therefore we shouldn’t call out errors. Sometimes it’s because it’s not a business priority to fix that mistake, and therefore it’s easier to not call it a mistake at all. Other times, it’s because strong egos can’t accept the egg-on-face effect of having suboptimal decisions attached to their legacy. This often happens with projects, and wanting to call projects a success, even if it ended up costing 5x more than originally planned and was delivered 2 years behind schedule (of an original 12 month schedule). I still hope I’ll one day end up in a company that is able to call a project a failure, and learn from the mistakes, instead of insisting on calling it a success, and ingraining the mistakes as successful ways of doing something.<p>This mindset—that everything must be framed as an exclusive success—could actually be why some of these decisional blunders continue to be made. Instead of admitting that something didn’t work, we double down on poor decisions.<p>So therefore, there’s an aspect of timing, or perspective: if you don’t know something is the wrong tool when you use it, then it isn’t the wrong tool in that moment. Hindsight might reveal that something was objectively the wrong tool. And context helps to explain or justify why a decision was made, and how that decision might even make sense for a given team.<p>But we should still be able to label things as a bad choice when they are identified, even if the only tangible benefit of doing so is to prevent making the same bad choice in the future.<p>Now, I’d like to clarify something: I don’t believe Microsoft switching to Golang instead of <code>$OTHER_LANG</code> is a mistake in any way, shape or form. As I <a href=https://mastodon.online/@teotwaki/114151731751082435>expressed previously</a>, I think it’s wonderful that Microsoft picked Golang, if and only if because this might finally curb the current trend of pigeonholing programming languages into a singular purpose.<p>Back in the day, Ruby gained insane popularity because it had an amazing development experience. TDD tools would happily flash at you in your terminal as you implemented features and completed your backlog. The code was so expressive that what started as APIs became DSLs, and it was glorious. Writing Ruby put a smile on my face. Many languages still haven’t caught up to the absolutely incredible devex that was achieved, in a completely IDE-agnostic way.<p>We used Ruby for web, for configuration management, for package management, to manage virtual machines, and to run exploits. And it was used for so many things exactly because of the devex.<p>Fish recently rewrote their codebase from C++ to Rust—not for performance, but for fun. That’s the energy we need to bring back into programming. As Steve wrote:<blockquote><p>You should write programs in the language you want to.</blockquote><p>Or to put it differently: trying to hammer in a nail using a screwdriver is a case of using the wrong tool for the job. Using a good programming language the team is comfortable and has fun with, <strong>isn’t</strong>.</section></article></main><div id=button-container><a title="Go to the top of the page" class=no-hover-padding href=# id=top-button> <svg viewbox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor><path d="M3.293 9.707a1 1 0 010-1.414l6-6a1 1 0 011.414 0l6 6a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414L11 5.414V17a1 1 0 11-2 0V5.414L4.707 9.707a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z"/></svg> </a></div></div><footer><section><nav class="socials nav-navs"><ul><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" href=https://blog.wedrop.it/atom.xml> <img alt=feed loading=lazy src=https://blog.wedrop.it/social_icons/rss.svg title=feed> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel=" me" href=https://github.com/teotwaki> <img alt=github loading=lazy src=https://blog.wedrop.it/social_icons/github.svg title=github> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel=" me" href=https://mastodon.online/@teotwaki> <img alt=mastodon loading=lazy src=https://blog.wedrop.it/social_icons/mastodon.svg title=mastodon> </a></ul></nav><nav class=nav-navs></nav><div class=credits><small> <p><p>Drop a Blog © 2025 Sebastian Lauwers • Unless otherwise noted, the content in this website is available under the <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a> license.</p> Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org>Zola</a> & <a href=https://github.com/welpo/tabi>tabi</a> • <a href=https://github.com/teotwaki/blog.wedrop.it> Site source </a></small></div></section><div class="search-modal js" aria-labelledby=modalTitle id=searchModal role=dialog><h1 class=visually-hidden id=modalTitle>Search</h1><div id=modal-content><div id=searchBar><div aria-hidden=true class=search-icon><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M784-120 532-372q-30 24-69 38t-83 14q-109 0-184.5-75.5T120-580q0-109 75.5-184.5T380-840q109 0 184.5 75.5T640-580q0 44-14 83t-38 69l252 252-56 56ZM380-400q75 0 127.5-52.5T560-580q0-75-52.5-127.5T380-760q-75 0-127.5 52.5T200-580q0 75 52.5 127.5T380-400Z"/></svg></div><input aria-controls=results-container aria-expanded=false autocomplete=off id=searchInput placeholder=Search… role=combobox spellcheck=false><div class="close-icon interactive-icon" title="Clear search" id=clear-search role=button tabindex=0><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="m256-200-56-56 224-224-224-224 56-56 224 224 224-224 56 56-224 224 224 224-56 56-224-224-224 224Z"/></svg></div></div><div id=results-container><div id=results-info><span id=zero_results> No results</span><span id=one_results> $NUMBER result</span><span id=many_results> $NUMBER results</span><span id=two_results> $NUMBER results</span><span id=few_results> $NUMBER results</span></div><div id=results role=listbox></div></div></div></div></footer>
