The media player, the conversations, the\napplication manager: these are all bits and pieces that lock the user away from freedom. And  that\nis, obviously, a bad thing.\nAs the conversation flowed, we pitched the idea of reimplementing the media player completely;\nwriting it from scratch, copying the user interface (as to not alienate users). Apart from a few\nvery serious flaws in Nokia’s current implementation, we wouldn’t actually try to improve change too\nmuch, and then let the community decide what is best for the media player. Basically, we wanted to\ngift the media player’s source code to the Community – an act of faith that Nokia has never deigned\nto grant its customers.\nA few weeks later, and we’re starting to get somewhere. Mohamad has done amazing work on the\ngraphical user interface, various contributors have donated time and brain matter in order to give\nus a rudimentary clone. I was very pleased. Then, it was decided to “announce” this development\neffort properly to the community.\nPeople deciding to work, and actually doing it, and for a good cause, nothing could be wrong, right?\nWrong. We got slammed. People started flaming about the feasability, about the usability,\nabout the needability; all in a very unobfuscated demeanour of stupidity.\nThe loudest people were well known Community Trolls: people who seemingly enjoy annoying others and\nengaging in relatively counter-productive behaviour. At the same time, the Community SSU (allowing\nthe Community to manage the software updates, rather than relying on Nokia, which has abandoned the\nplatform) was announced by very much the same group of people as those responsible for the Media\nPlayer reimplementation; by and large the same trollish and counter-productive responses were given\nto this project as well.\nI didn’t understand this. Why, again and again, would people start yelling and screaming as soon as\nsomething was done. I first naively attributed it to the fact people don’t like change, but then I\nnoticed, somehow, the same behaviour at work. Luckily not “the same” – we don’t have people\nbehaving like hooligans as soon as one offers food for thought – however both reactions couldn’t be\nentirely happening at random.\nThere are two discussions at my company, in particular, that have “leaked” in that sense. One was\nabout Source Control Management, a purely technical discussion that, yes, – hypothetically, could\nhave – affected a few people, the other about the technical architecture of a system-wide method of\ncommunication. Both discussions stalled in quite a dramatic manner, mostly because everyone wanted\nto see their own ideology put forward.\nIn full disclosure, I pitched the SCM-discussion, and having rather not adapted to the French’s\ninability to understand candour (’t was my first week, after all), may be partly to blame for how\nbadly it degenerated.\nThis being said, the other discussion, about some architectural decision, I believe is an excellent\nexample of misdirected management: instead of asking people how they can contribute (read: help make\nthe current solution better), you ask them if they see an issue. The immediate response, usually, is\n“Yes, however we don’t have it if we do it my way”. Don’t ask them to offer a solution, insist\nthat they improve the current one.\nI then started searching, online, as I would research a technical problem. At some point, someone on\nTwitter pointed me towards a seemingly random, if well named, website. I’ll quote a bit of it\n(though, reading the whole page is definitely worth it):\n\nParkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and get approval for building a\nmulti-million or even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you\nwill be tangled up in endless discussions.\nParkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so vast, so expensive and so\ncomplicated that people cannot grasp it, and rather than try, they fall back on the assumption\nthat somebody else checked all the details before it got this far.\n[…]\nA bike shed on the other hand. Anyone can build one of those over a weekend, and still have time\nto watch the game on TV. So no matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with\nyour proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his job, that he is paying\nattention, that he is here.\n\nWhoa. Poul-Henning Kamp, where the hell have you been all this time? There really isn’t much more to\nsay; PHK’s text is so painfully insightful and well written that I don’t have any words.\nWe all have our bike sheds to build. But frankly, I’d rather not build them over the weekend. So\nwhen you hit reply, think very, very carefully about what you are going to type next. Be extremely\nthorough, and assume good faith. Put your ego aside, and let the person who launched an initiative\ndrive it. You may be piqued that you didn’t do it, that they implemented an idea before you had the\ntime; the truth is you should embrace this.\nRegardless of the context in which you interpret these words (an Open Source project, your job),\nplease remember that in most cases everyone is sharing the same goal; everyone is trying to further\nthings, and improve things.\nIt is not because you think you have the intellectual, or technological, or managerial right to\ncomment on something that you should.\n","description":"Observations on poorly executed change management in a FOSS setting","id":"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/bike-shed/","path":"/blog/bike-shed/","title":"The bike shed"},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/boys-birthday-gift/":{"body":"\nOnce upon a time, there was a little boy who really wanted a dog. For a few days now, he’d been\nasking his mother if he could have one. It didn’t need to be big. Even a small one would do. They\nlived on an old farm, had a big garden, and they already had a horse, and a cat. “A dog would\ncomplete the picture nicely”, he argued. At every occasion, the little boy would remind his mother\ndearest of his wish. As the months went by, his desire never wavered. He wanted, in no uncertain\nterms, a dog.\nAs the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, the boy’s birthday approached. His\nmother asked him, “Do you really want a dog?”. “Oh yes, mother dearest”, he replied, “a dog is all I\nwould want for my birthday”. His mother made him regret his eagerness. “Even if it means you don’t\nget a bike?”\nSadly, time had come for the family to move houses. The old farm was too far away from civilisation,\nand there were no buses going from the tiny village to the schools. As such, the horse would be\ngoing to an aunt, and the cat would come with, to the city. The new house was in the process of\nbeing renovated, and it would be a few months before they could move in. The boy would be getting a\nmassive bedroom, on the third floor, to make up for the fact that they would not have a garden\nanymore, where he used to spend most of his free time.\nAs you do, the boy could barely contain his joy on the morning of his birthday. He was convinced\nthat today, he would finally be getting a dog. And if not a dog, a nice new bike. As breakfast drew\nto a close, the boy was disappointed that he hadn’t received any gifts, but his mood lifted when his\nmother concluded the meal with “Shall we go visit your birthday gift?”\nThe boy could barely contain his excitement in the car. “Why isn’t the gift at the farm?” he asked.\n“Is it at the new house?” he continued. His mother confirmed. The gift had to be at the new house,\nand had to stay there. It was too difficult to move it. He asked whether the gift was too big to be\ntransported in a car. His mother explained that it wasn’t too big, it was just not very practical.\nHe asked whether it was impractical because the gift was alive. She smiled, and nodded.\nFinally. A dog. After nearly a whole year of asking for one.\nThe car was parked, and the new house’s front door was unlocked. “Where is it? Where is it?” he\nasked. “In the courtyard, behind the house.” The boy ran through the maze that was the ground floor,\njumping over paint buckets and ducking under construction equipment. He opened the door to the small\nsquare courtyard, and didn’t see anything. He ran up the staircase that led to a small terrace,\nhoping to find his new best friend asleep in the sun. The terrace was equally empty.\n“He’s gone!” the boy yelled, “He managed to escape!”\n“No, they’re right here!” his mother retorted.\n“They?” he mumbled. Confused, he peered over the railing, and saw his mother looking up at him while\npointing at what could only be described as a glass jar, mounted atop some kind of metal legs.\nUtterly and ultimately deflated, he slowly walked down the stairs in disbelief. He approached the\nweird object that he had rushed past initially, and realised it was filled with water. Some things\nwere moving inside. “This one is called Freddy, and this one is called John, after Freddy Mercury\nand John Lennon.” His birthday gift was a pair of goldfish.\nOriginal cover photo by Johan Bakker.\n","description":"Once upon a time, there was a little boy who really wanted a dog.","id":"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/boys-birthday-gift/","path":"/blog/boys-birthday-gift/","title":"The boy's birthday gift"},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/breaking-the-ranks/":{"body":"\nPlease note: This entry was written over the course of a few months; some of the chronology might\nnot make sense.\nFor the fourth time in eighteen months, I am on my way to Belgium. For the fourth time, it is to\nthank someone for being there, and tell them goodbye for one last and final time.\nToday, however, is the second time in less than a fortnight. I saw this someone exactly two weeks\nago; I hung out at his house, with his brother; I played Play-Doh with his daughter; I enjoyed his\nfather’s waffles and music; I embraced his mother like an aunt. I’ve never been to a friend’s\nfuneral. I’ve never received a call that said “this person who was in your life for nearly twenty\nyears has decided to end things.”\nMany years ago, my family was in the south of France, near Pézénas. We had been enjoying a very\nrelaxing holiday, when one late morning, as the sun was finishing its slow rise in the sky, this\nloud tribe from East Flanders parked their cars in the middle of the pedestrian area next to the\npool, and proceeded to unload the bare necessities. A massive CRT display. The computer tower that\nwent with it. A full-size synth. A stereo, complete with tape and CD players. A handful of easels,\nalongside some blank canvas, and all the knick knacks that go with the art of painting and drawing.\nGuitars. A microwave. The bare necessities.\nNow, you have to understand that this is the early-to-mid nineties, and we were in a village of\nmaybe a couple thousand people. Imagine, if you will, five bungalows strung together to form a\nlow-roofed L-shaped building, tightly hugging a swimming pool, in the back garden of a beloved and\nrespected man who used to be the equally beloved, and well-respected mayor in this small village.\nRenting out these small bungalows to (comparatively) rich Belgians was his retirement fund. The\nwhole concept that he was selling to tourists was quietly baking in the mid-afternoon sun, with a\nbadly written, cheap best-seller in your lap, all the while trying to drown out the wild echoes of\nkids playing in the swimming pool.\nI remember sitting on the side of said pool, with my sister, and maybe one of the local girls,\nfeeling annoyed and bewildered as they unloaded their cars with all these things that I thought were\nfantastically fascinating, yet completely out of place. I didn’t realise yet that for many years to\ncome, this scene was the picture I would be seeing in my mind when I would hear the word “Vikings.”\nNortherners without respect for the local wildlife, stomping loudly on everything; an invading,\ndisorganised bunch of people.\nAnother memory that will stay with me forever is how two of the boys from the horde of invading\nVikings—after having thrown some of their belongings from the back of a car into the room or bed\nthey had claimed—decided that they had done their share of the required invasion chores. In a\nswift movement, they threw their t-shirt onto the ground, and ran at full speed; yelling at the top\nof their lungs; towards the swimming pool. I still have this one picture in my mind of two shirtless\nboys wearing cut-off denim shorts suspended in mid-air above the swimming pool; a polished belt\nbuckle reflecting the midday sun shooting over our heads like an improbable shooting star. They had\njumped into our sacred waters without even so much as a hello or even asking for permission.\nFairly quickly, we realised that the techno Vikings were actually incredibly nice people. It still\ntook a few days, or maybe even more, for us to actually start appreciating them. I honestly don’t\nremember whether it was because my sister fell for the middle brother, I became friends with the\nyoungest one, or my mom became slightly involved with the oldest brother, but we ended up spending\nquite a bit of time with them. I remember always having trouble understanding their dialect.\nLimburgs is a fairly melodious version of Flemish, with a reasonable amount of French thrown in.\nBack in Belgium, throughout the years, we would sometimes go see them at their house, in the far\naway province of Limburg. Belgian distances are a very weird thing. People gasp when you say you’re\ngoing on a 80 km drive after 5 in the afternoon. “You’ll never make it before night,” they say. “Are\nyou sure it’s not better to spend the night here?” they ask. “Do you need some sammiches for the\nroad?” they kindly offer. A few weeks ago, I realised that going to their house was only 10 km\nfurther than going to see my grandparents. Sometimes we would do the trip to my grandparents\nmultiple times a day. When going to see these friends, it would take a week or so of planning,\nmultiple phone calls. I’d only be slightly exaggerating when saying that we would stock up on\nprovisions for the trek ahead.\nI remember discovering their house for the first time. It was so full. So alive. The walls felt a\ndifferent kind of warm. As though they were radiating an energy that I hadn’t encountered before.\nUpon entering the house, you were immediately overcome with an intimate feeling of “cosy”. The\nexposed wooden beams, the fireplace, the smell of sweet aromas that permeated through walls, wood\nand cloth; it all contributed to this feeling of appeasement and, as the years went by, a feeling of\n“you’re finally home.” To this day, it is a variation of this house that I imagine when I read or\nthink about the Weasley’s house in the Potter books. Kids from the neighbourhood just dropped by. I\nseem to remember they just came in through the back door and went up to their friends’ rooms without\nknocking or ringing the door bell. Actually, I seem to remember there was no door bell until many,\nmany years later.\nIn those days, upon arrival at their house, you would simply have to knock on the massive front door\nand hope that someone was within hearing range. Mostly, because the kids were playing loud music\nupstairs, and the parents were either busy in the kitchen, or busy working on their respective\ncrafts, you would more often than not have to let yourself into this wondrous world by simply\nwalking around the house into the back garden (this may seem evident to people from other countries,\nbut Belgium never has “open” gardens). Sometimes one of the brothers would have heard you park\nyour car nilly-willy in the driveway, and you’d be greeted by a “Heelaba!” (which is neither French\nnor Dutch, but a weird amalgamation of the two) emanating from a splendidly smiling face—itself\nconnected to a body perilously jutting halfway out of a window frame, one storey too high.\nThe mother would immediately start caring for us, ensuring that we were always properly fed and\nhydrated. The father would be the joker and entertainer. Many “Oohs” and “Aahs” were expelled as we\ngot to discover the new portraits that the mother had drawn or painted. Genuine exclamations, at\nthat. Each visit started the same. My sister and I felt that we had to stay on the ground floor for\nat least a few minutes. We didn’t want to seem impolite or not wanting to spend time with the\nparents… but it was their sons that we really came to visit. Said brotherhood would awkwardly sit\nwith us, next to the parents, until what seemed like an appropriate amount of time had passed,\nmostly in silence, listening to the parents ask the usual mundane questions parents tend to ask kids\nthey don’t really know. “Which grade are you in now?” my mother would ask. “Are you still playing\nthe guitar?” their father would enquire. Then, one of the kids would break the ranks, and just like\nany rout, one was all it took. As soon as the first one left, we would all follow.\nI owe a lot to those brothers. The youngest one taught me a lot about computer networks, piracy and\nintroduced me to Star Trek. We both favoured Voyager to any of the other Star Treks, and (for me at\nleast), that’s still the case, although TNG is a very, very close second. The oldest brother gave me\nmy first CB, and introduced me to IRC. I can’t have been much older than 10 or 11 at the time. I was\nfascinated by the fact that nearly a decade before I would get access to always-on internet, they\nalready had a very serious internet connection. The whole house was wired into “the net”, with the\ngood old BNC ethernet cables, and the whole street (or at least, those who cared) was linked in.\nNow, you have to remember that this is in the mid-to-late nineties, where the vast majority of\npeople didn’t have a computer at home. The main method to transfer data from one machine to another\nwas floppy disks. I created my first ICQ account with them. I created my first email address with\nthem. As much as I credit one of my uncles with throwing me head-first into the world of Linux, I\nhave to credit these brothers for throwing me into the original web.\nTime seemed to slow down whenever we were at their place. The amount of information I was ingesting\nprobably caused a time-dilation effect, or something. Luckily, because they lived so very, very\nfar away, we only went on weekends. And because everyone was perfectly matched up, we always ended\nup leaving much later than what would have been socially acceptable with other house calls.\nAs the years passed, I sort of lost touch with the youngest brother. I’m still not sure why—I was\npretty weird as a teenager. To paraphrase Rives, maybe one of his boyfriends got drunk one night and\naccidentally ate our friendship. The oldest brother became a very successful business creator and\nowner, and being as dedicated as he is, I think he purposefully avoided us to not waste time. I\nremember one discussion with him, a few years after I had started working, where he tried to\nconvince me to not waste my time on open source stuff. He explained that every minute he spent on\nhis computer was only to increase the value of his product(s). I completely understand and admire\nhis passion and focus, but I also remember thinking—then, and still now—that I value my\ncomputers as a hobby way too much for that. I enjoy simply playing with something for the joy of\nplaying with it. Because of the lack of availability of the two other brothers, and maybe just like\natoms want to bond with one another, the middle brother and I grew closer with every meet up. We\ntalked more. He wanted to show me the nice side of being a twenty-something, long before I had any\ninterest in that. We went cruising into the city centre, music blaring. He transmitted his passion\nfor VW Golfs to me, and the first car I would buy, many years later, was a beat up Golf GT 3.\nI loved talking to him. Debating with him. I didn’t take his statements at face value. I forced him\nto back them up through logic and deduction. We spent hours, days, weeks talking. When he came to\nvisit us in the south of France, we would keep talking and debating until the wee hours of the\nnight. Because we lived so far away (both in Belgium, and later after my family moved to the south\nof France), our main method of communication was through the internet. ICQ and IRC at first,\nfollowed by MSN, and finally WhatsApp. I’ve always been uncomfortable writing Dutch, so we quickly\nswitched to speaking English for most of our life.\nHe was incredibly spiritual, but having grown up in a family of freethinkers, had not received a\nformal religious education (as far as I know). I had been raised as a Catholic, but was, at that\ntime, a vehement atheist, preaching the Holy Word of Richard Dawkins (the man nicknamed “Darwin’s\nBulldog”). He would talk to me about how he could read the lines in my hand. He wasn’t trying to\nconvince me he could actually do it. He just liked talking about what it would mean, if it meant\nanything. I loved exploring the way his brain worked, because it truly was unique, and I think he\nenjoyed my curiosity as well. The fascinating part of his brain is that you could ask him why he\nheld a specific belief, and he would walk you through his reasoning. He didn’t ride a high horse. He\nwasn’t condescending. He wasn’t offended. When you questioned one of his assumptions, he honestly\ngave it thought. He would pause, and think as he tried to understand your position. He was by far\none of the humblest people I knew.\nDue to his condition, he was fairly prone to freak-outs. A small thing would happen, and his brain\nwould implode, unable to get a grasp on reality. It could be a tiny thing. Once, we decided to\ninstall Ubuntu Linux on his laptop, at maybe 3 in the morning. I downloaded the software, burned it\nto a CD, and fed it to the computer. After a few minutes of thinking about it, the computer decided\nit was happy, and showed a beautiful desktop. To greet us, the operating system played a nice little\nchime (a small drum roll, if memory serves). My friend freaked the hell out. He threw the computer\non the ground, as though it was suddenly a thousand degrees and charring his legs. He just looked at\nme, terrified, and whispered “the speakers don’t work any more.” After a few minutes, we established\nthat Linux was simply able to use the speakers, and that the Windows driver must have been\ncorrupted. Correction: I established that. He was convinced that it was proof he had been hacked.\nThat somebody had been listening to him for years, and thus destroying his speakers. It took me the\nbetter part of an hour to calm him down and convince him there wasn’t anything else at play.\nAnother example was when I took him out to play pool. This time around, I owned the Golf, and I took\nhim to my town. He had come to visit us in the south of France, alone with a girl that he hoped\nwould become his girlfriend. They’d driven the whole way down, and there were already some issues\nbetween them. I decided to take him out to one of my usual hideouts—a crummy café with a couple\ndozen pool tables—to take his mind off things. As I was lining up to take my shot, he leaned\nagainst another pool table, and all of a sudden started yelling “Fuck, fuck, fuck, nee, nee, nee!”\nHis credit card, lodged in the back pocket of his cut-off denim shorts had snapped along the line of\nthe magnetic strip. He held up the limp corpse of his credit card in mid-air, staring at me with\npanicked eyes and started to pull at his hair as adrenaline was being rushed through his body. It\nwas an inconvenience, but it wasn’t a big deal. I could’ve fronted him the cash for the end of his\nstay, and he could wire me the money back when he got back to Belgium. Or maybe his parents could\nwire some money to a local bank, and he could get the cash instead. Alas, his mind decided it was a\nbig deal. It took me nearly 2 or 3 hours to calm him down. Most of that time spent on the café’s\nparking lot, chain smoking cigarettes.\nThere’s an interesting parallel to be made, though. That night, I took him out in my Golf and went\nto drive down town, playing loud music and annoying passers-by, replaying the memory of him driving\nme around, years earlier. Back when he was the one driving, I wasn’t interested in that at all. Now\nthat I was the one behind the steering wheel, I don’t think he was interested by it. My mind, then,\nwas preoccupied with whatever teenage angst I was going through. He, in another “then”, was starting\nto worry about having been on earth for over a quarter century, and not having had any long-term\nrelationship to show for it. In separate timelines, we both put up with it, for the sake of the\nother one. Because we knew each of us was just living out a specific moment. A fantasy. We were\nwilling participants.\nHe was like a brother to me. His whole family is exactly that to me—family. For years, they were\nmy mental refuge. I would look up to the oldest brother when I lost motivation in my work, when I\nwould ask “why do I even bother working this hard?”; the youngest brother when I needed the courage\nto be my own self; the middle brother to remind myself that no matter what life threw at me, there’s\nalways a way forward. Their house was my mental palace—the place where I would store things that I\nneeded to safe-keep, the precious memories I needed to protect and a way to lock up the thoughts\nthat needed to be kept away (this metaphor makes a lot more sense if you’ve watched the BBC’s\nexcellent Sherlock series). Every single person in that family has qualities that I aspire to. In\na number of ways, they have been a mental compass for me.\nI think he enjoyed talking to me. If he didn’t, he was a great actor. The last time I saw him, he\nwas trying to learn programming. He spent a lot of time on the phone with his older brother, trying\nto learn C# and .Net. We talked about the philosophy of Object Oriented Programming. What does a\nmethod call mean? I tried explaining the concepts of encapsulation and separation of concerns. I\nhonestly don’t know whether any of it stuck. He was so excited about learning something new. He was\nraving about how .Net was the only thing you’d ever need, full stop. Sadly, that evening, I couldn’t\nstay very long, as I had to attend my grandfather’s funeral the next morning. We vaped on his\nterrace for a few minutes, just before I left, and we talked about how next time, he should come\nand visit me in Copenhagen. We arranged that he would try and come in February or March; or maybe\neven for the new year. We hugged it out, tightly, as we always did when we said goodbye. That warm\nand friendly embrace that is less about saying hello or goodbye, and more about just showing\nappreciation and affection. He guided me as I backed up my car onto the road, and I drove off. I\ndidn’t need the guidance, but I let him. I think he was just imitating his father.\nLittle did I know that it was the last time I would see one of my best friends. He was taken by a\nmental illness that he had been battling for most of his life. Nay, an illness that his whole\nfamily had been fighting for decades.\nThe day after receiving news of his passing, I stood in front of the massive wooden door of the\nfamily house. This door, which for so many years I had always been looking forward to knock on, now\nscared the hell out of me. I tried a few times to walk up to it and just ring the doorbell, but\ncouldn’t—not right away, at least. I don’t even remember who opened the door. This house that\nusually warmed you up to the core now chilled my bones. I just remember his mom trying to show her\neternal warmth and trying to be welcoming. As she walked towards me, she greeted me with such a soft\nand genuine smile. She thanked me for coming all the way from Denmark, telling me I shouldn’t have.\nBy the time I held her in my arms, she was weeping and sobbing, crying into my shoulder, asking me\nwhy he had done it. Asking whether I had known. Asking if he’d said anything.\nThere are no words.\nIn that situation, there is nothing one can say. Our whole society trains us, educates us in the\ncommon idioms to use when somebody passes. The pleasantries to exchange in order to make the\nliving feel better. Words to appease the survivors. I remember uttering “she led a very long and\nbeautiful life” just a few months prior. Or maybe the more spiritual “he’s in a better place now”\nfrom a fortnight earlier. None of those stupid phrases work in this scenario. You just hold them,\nand you sob with them. So I held her, and quietly sobbed with her, in the middle of the door frame.\nYou hope someone comes to comfort her. As if anyone could come and comfort a mourning mother for the\ndeath of her son. You wait, politely, for someone to break the ranks. You answer the stupid\nquestions, whose answers nobody actually cares about. “Did you fly in this morning?” someone will\nask. You simply take in and smile at the more difficult questions. “Why did you even bother coming?”\nsomeone else might ask.\nYou show them that he was loved. You show them that they are, too. You show them how to undelete the\npictures that didn’t make the cut just a week ago. You go through the recycle bin on their phone to\nrecover the pictures that were too blurry or overexposed. They’re good enough, now. They’re\nprecious enough, now. You have some soup or some cake, and you join in on the chorus when everyone\nsays how good it is. This time, the “Ooohs” and “Aaahs” aren’t any less genuine; they just have a\ndifferent undertone. You play Duplo with his daughter, and you try to keep it together when she says\n“I think daddy has slept enough now; now he has to come play with me.” And then you try to figure\nout when you’re supposed to leave. Not because you don’t want to be there, but because you can’t\ntell when they don’t want you there any more. When they can’t have you there any more. Again, you\nwait, politely, for someone to break the ranks.\nAnd you force yourself to remember the good parts. Him greeting you through a window with a gorgeous\nsmile. Him driving you around down town. Him hugging you one very last time. Him being eternally\npositive about getting you to quit smoking, even though he never managed to kick it, for good.\nTalking about mountain bikes. Talking about heart breaks. Talking about what we want to be in five\nyears.\nCover photo by Jeremy Bishop.\n","description":"For the fourth time in eighteen months, I am on my way to Belgium.

I think it is one of the best ISPs in the world, and even more so in France. If I’m not\nmistaken, they invented the ISP-provided set top box that seems so common place these days. Their\nWikipedia entry explains some of the reasons I like them so much, but to list a few:\n\nunmetered bandwidth,\nfixed IPv4 address, /60 IPv6 block,\nthey allowed and encouraged people to run their own servers (reverse-IP customisation, every port\navailable, etc),\ntheir router doesn’t suck,\nfixed price policy: ~30 euros, all inclusive,\nthe IPTV streams are viewable on your PCs through VLC,\nthe list could go on for a long time.\n\nAll this being said, one of the major reason I loved their product so much was because of their\nmodem, the Freebox. I’ve been a long fan of all their hardware (since the V4), but\nthe Freebox Revolution takes the cake.\nAnyway, back on topic. The Freebox Revolution Server allows you to set an RSS feed, and all items in\nthis RSS feed will be automatically downloaded by the newsgroup/torrent/direct download client that\nis built into the router (yeah, they have that built in).\nI used to use a seedbox, but because I had a really bad DSL connection (4 Mbits), I preferred for my\ndownloads to happen during the day—when nobody was home—rather than having to painstakingly wait\nfor the bits to transfer when I was home. The other reason was also that downloading anything would\nimmediately saturate the link, and ruin browsing/YouTubing for anyone home at that point. The other\nmain point that should be stressed is that the Freebox Player (the part connected to the TV) could\nstream any file stored on the Server’s hard drive (it acted as a NAS, out of the box). This meant\nthat we were able to watch the new GoT episode faster than most of my colleagues who had FTTH\nconnections, simply because we just had to turn the telly on, and click “Play”.\nI came up with the following script to generate an RSS feed of downloaded files that my Freebox\nwould then automatically pick up.\n\nThis was called by a cron job every 5 minutes:\n\nThe reason that sed command is there is because the Freebox doesn’t understand the enclosure tag\nthat is generated by PyRss2Gen. Yeah, that one took a while to debug and figure out.\nWhile this setup worked very nicely, every couple of months, the Freebox would simply stop\ndownloading new items. In the router’s WebOS, I’d force updates to the RSS feed, but nothing would\nshow up. The feed would be empty. After some time, I figured out that it was due to the Freebox not\nbeing able to cope with the size of the RSS file. So here’s the hack-ish remedy for that, you’ve\nguessed it, another cron job:\n\nThis setup worked very nicely for the better part of 5 years, while we lived in France.\nSo thank you Free, and all the engineers behind the amazing ISP that you are, and all the engineers\nwho make the Freebox possible.

My last post was written at the request of a friend who asked me\nto share a childhood memory. And that was in 2019! I think it’s high time to actually start writing\nmore things that I can share.

Just\nto be clear: this is a low-priority challenge for me. I don’t expect anything out of this, and I\ndon’t consider it to be anything more than yet another toy-project to keep my mind busy whenever I\nhave a moment to spare.\nThe challenge is as follows:\n\nWhat is the anagram of “poultry outwits ants” whose md5 hash computes down to\n4624d200580677270a54ccff86b9610e?\n\nSounds simple enough, right? That’s what I thought as well. Let’s start by doing some math:\nThere are 18 letters in the seed anagram, not including spaces. Let’s leave the spaces aside for the\nmoment and just focus on those 18 letters. How many permutations of letters are there? Well, that’s\nfairly easy, let’s head up to WolframAlpha and calculate some\nfactorials:\n\nJust shy of 6.5 quadrillion possibilities? Not bad. Now, let’s see what throwing in\nthose spaces changes…\n\nBetween 51 quintillion possibilities and 25 sixtillion possibilities,\nassuming there are respectively 3 to 5 words in the actual anagram. Wow. We now know how many\npossible permutations there are. These are purely permutations (e.g.: theoretical anagrams), and not\nactually matched to real, existing words. That’s another step. Let’s just go with these numbers and\nsee how long it would take to calculate all of these.\nHow fast is my computer? I’m writing this on a small, cheap netbook that runs off battery power. I’m\nnot expecting much out of it. Let’s see what John the ripper thinks of my CPU.\n\nI’m taking md5crypt as a low baseline, as I’m guesstimating it to be more computationally intensive\nthan just calculating the md5 sum of small strings. Let’s assume I get a thousand boxes like mine,\nslightly more powerful (four cores instead of two):\n\n20 billion hashes per second, that’s pretty good, and in our era of cloud computing, surely not that\nimpossible to achieve. How long would it take me to crack the challenge, by simple, honest to\ngoodness bruteforce?\n\nSo, assuming perfect workload distribution, and assuming no overhead from the software, it would\ntake around 80 years to calculate the md5 hash of every single possible anagram.\nNow, I realise those are very, very low values; maybe more worthy of vapour that cloud computing.\nAccording to Andrew Dunham, it is possible to get up to 2.3 billion md5 hashes per second\nper Amazon EC2 GPU cluster. So assuming an hourly rate of USD 0.7, it would only cost under USD 5\nmillion to calculate everything, but it would still take nearly as\nlong as to put a human on this planet. Note that those numbers are for 1000 GPU\nclusters; The reason I didn’t go for the million-figure in this estimate is because I somehow\nstrongly doubt the fact that Amazon has a spare million GPU clusters lying around.\nI love a good challenge as much as the next guy, but I don’t have that kind of time or money to\nthrow at just something to keep my brain idling. So where do we go from now? Let’s look at the\nchallenge again. Hey, they gave us a list of words! That must be useful, right? Of\ncourse it is!\nHow many words did they give us?\n\nWait, how many unique words did they give us?\n\nOK, so let’s remove any word that contains a letter that doesn’t exist in our seed anagram: poultry\noutwits ants. Time to let go of bash and friends, and call in the big guns: Python.\n\nLet’s give it a run and see how many words we managed to squash out:\n\nOK, we managed to remove 98.32% of the words list provided by Trustpilot. This definitely reduces\nthe amount of calculations we’re going to have to perform, but it doesn’t really make things that\nmuch easier. Let’s look at why.\nThe usual way to calculate the number of permutations will again be based around factorials, as we\nused previously. As before, let’s assume the target anagram is made of 3 words, just like the seed\nanagram. What would be the formula to calculate that? Well actually, the Python\ndocumentation gives it right to us:\n\nSo applied to our problem:\n\nI guess it would be possible to load up a Cassandra cluster with 240GB of data and use Apache Spark\nto carve through it, but it doesn’t really seem like the right way to do it.\nIn the next article (part 2), we’ll write a quick python script that starts crunching\nthrough the list of words and find a way to discard impossible permutations.\n","description":"An analysis of Trustpilot's hash anagram programming challenge","id":"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/hash-anagram-challenge-part-1/","path":"/blog/hash-anagram-challenge-part-1/","title":"Hash anagram challenge, part 1"},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/hash-anagram-challenge-part-2/":{"body":"This is part two of my attempt to solve the Hash Anagram challenge offered by TrustPilot. Full\ndisclosure: These articles are not written in chronological order; I finished the challenge a few\nweeks ago. I’m merely documenting my mental process, and trying to get back into proper writing. In\nthis part, we’ll start writing a small script that crunches the words, and do some rough\nbenchmarking on it, to see whether our approach actually makes sense or not.\nIn part 1, we saw that we have a couple thousand words to work with. We also saw that\nworking from the letters in the seed anagram alone, there were a few quintillion possible\npermutations.\nSo what kind of algorithms could we apply to this problem, to try and solve it? Let’s try to restate\nthe problem in order to see things more clearly:\n\nGiven a list of 1758 words, find a permutation of n words whose md5 hash computes to\n4624d200580677270a54ccff86b9610e.\n\nFirst, let’s lay down some observations:\n\nThere are 18 letters in the seed anagram, hence the number of letters in the target anagram will\nbe 18 as well;\nWe don’t know how many words the target anagram contains;\nWe don’t know how many permutations of the words list are actual anagrams.\n\nTechnically, we could assume that the target anagram contains nothing more than three words, but I\ndon’t want to make that assumption.\nI see two main algorithmic paths:\n\nGenerate all possible word permutations, and filter it down;\nRecursively append words to one another until an anagram is found.\n\nSo how do you check whether a string is an anagram of another string? I’ve found the following\nalgorithm in Python:\n\nAnd an equivalent implementation in C:\n\nThe main issue I see with both implementations is that we actually need to do allocations in order\nto verify that two strings are anagrams of each other. Granted, the allocations in C are way smaller\nand more manageable than the Python ones, but still, not great. If you know of an algorithm that\ndoesn’t require allocations, I’d be happy to hear about it.\nTalking about allocations, what could we do to reduce their numbers? At the moment, the only check\nwe do before undergoing any allocation, both in Python and C, is checking whether both strings are\nthe same. How could we cut that down? This is my train of thought:\nCharacters are encoded into their ASCII value, and for lowercase letters in the alphabet, their\nvalue will range between 97 and 122. What happens if we add the values of our seed anagram (letters\nonly, no spaces)?\n\nRegardless of the order of the letters, an anagram of “poultry outwits ants” will always have the\nsame order point sum. The reverse, however, isn’t true: a string that has an order point sum value\nof 2036 isn’t necessarily an anagram of “poultry outwits ants”. Let’s throw that into our code:\n\nExcellent. Let’s try to do the same in C:\n\nI decided to write the C version as a single function, so as to only have to loop over the two\nstrings once. The Python version uses a more functional approach.\nGreat, so we now have a way to approximate whether a string might be an anagram without doing any\nallocations, and a way to know whether a string really is an anagram of another string. Let’s put\ntogether a quick script that gives us all the permutations and starts pumping out anagrams, but\nfirst, let’s use our newfound quicktester to spare some CPU cycles:\n\nAnd now for the main function:\n\nI let this run for a few minutes, and as luck would have it, it actually spat out the answer:\n\nWait, trustpilot? Would the answer just be “trustpilot wants you”? Nevermind, I haven’t tested\nany md5 hashes or anything, so I won’t cheat. The major issue with using itertools.permutations is\nthat it’s pretty difficult to run on a cluster, and looking at the speed, it’s not going to complete\nquickly. What I mean by speed is that a quick benchmark shows that the Python script running on my\nnetbook is capable of rougly 50k permutations per second. Going back to the number crunching we did\nin part 1, how many different permutations are there for n ranging from 1 to 5?\n\nI don’t even need to calculate how long that would take to know it would be a very, very long time\n(hint: they should’ve started back in the Copper Age). Now obviously, I wouldn’t\nneed to test every single permutation; especially if I check the md5 hash every time I find an\nanagram.\nSo how can we split the work across multiple cores? I know just the library for the job:\nZeroMQ. ZeroMQ (also written ØMQ) is a great tool to have on your belt. It doesn’t\nrequire much, other than a good ol’ paradigm shift (POP!).\n\nZeroMQ makes multithreading and multiprocessing easy. Well, it doesn’t, it just makes communicating\nbetween multiple threads, processes or servers a piece of cake. The PyZMQ bindings are\nexcellent, and they make everything an absolute pleasure to work with. ZeroMQ takes care of managing\nthe sockets, establishing or receiving connections, polling and whatnot. Instead of working with\ndumb sockets, ZeroMQ offers pre-defined socket types that behave in certain ways (request/response,\nrouter, publish/subscribe, etc.).\nHere’s the architecture we’ll deploy, simple and concise:\n\nThe server will take care of downloading and reducing the wordlist;\nWhen a client asks for a word, the server will sequentially go through its words list, and send\nthe next word to a client;\nUpon exhausting all possibilities for a given word, the client will send back all the anagrams it\nfound, and request a new word.\n\nLater on, we’ll teach clients to also switch to md5 computing tasks if there are any. This will\nallow us to not spend the next 8000 years computing, but also completing the challenge.\nZeroMQ gives us a socket we can talk on between the clients and the server, but what dialect should\nwe employ? These days, I usually default to JSON; it’s very well supported and can encode nearly all\nthe types of data one usually needs. It compresses fairly well, and isn’t too verbose, yet remains\nhuman-readable. And hey look! PyZMQ offers convenience functions to read/write in JSON directly!\nThe other question we should probably answer is “What kind of sockets are we going to use?” For the\nsake of simplicity, we’re going to use one of ZeroMQ’s simplest socket types: the Request-Response\ncombo. Let’s take a moment to define the grammar of our dialect:\n\nLet’s start by creating our server. Most of the stuff will remain the same, we’re just going to add\na small class that keeps track of the current word, and stuff like that:\n\nAnd this is again where I’m going to call it a night ;) I’ll finish writing this article tomorrow or\nsomething.

It’s a great article, and I highly recommend it.\nAt one point, Steve mentions that he’s not a big fan of the “choose the right tool for the job”\ntrope that we hear very often in software engineering circles:\n\nThere’s some sort of balance here to be struck. But at the same time, I hate “choose the right\ntool for the job” as a suggestion. Other than art projects, has anyone ever deliberately chosen\nthe wrong tool? Often, something that seems like the wrong tool is chosen simply because the\ncontextual requirements weren’t obvious to you, the interlocutor.\n\nI’m not entirely certain how broad the definition of “contextual requirements” is, but provided it\ndoes not include laziness, I believe that there are many examples where people have chosen the wrong\ntool for the job, deliberately.\nI, myself, am the first one to be guilty of this. And I’m almost entirely convinced that you are,\ntoo. Growing up, I had a decent collection of pocket knives, and would always have one with me when\nI was roaming the countryside. My pocket knife was a pry bar, a screw driver, a bottle opener, a\ncoal rake, a skewer, a windlass, and a toothpick.\nFurthermore, how many of us used our tongues to see if a 9V battery still had a charge in it or not?\nI still readily reach for a butter knife when I need to unscrew a flathead screw without opening my\ntoolbox. How many PMs have used Visio or PowerPoint as a project management tool? How many build\nsystems started out as “a quick shell script”? How many businesses have critical Excel documents\nas the source of truth, or even as an entire database?\nIn some cases, one might argue that these choices were made out of necessity. Maybe that’s the\ncontextual requirement factor Steve mentions. Is it really, though? One of the most well-known\nStackOverflow answers documents why one should never use regexes to try and\nparse HTML. It is perhaps one of the best examples of Maslow’s hammer that we have for software\ndevelopment. No matter how many warnings, no matter how complex the grammar, once people grasp the\nbasics of regular expressions they believe they can parse anything with them. After years of that\nanswer being published, and legions of regex aficionados “Yes, but…”’ing him, the author gave up:\n\nI think it’s time for me to quit the post of Assistant Don’t Parse HTML With Regex Officer. No\nmatter how many times we say it, they won’t stop coming every day… every hour even. It is a lost\ncause, which someone else can fight for a bit. So go on, parse HTML with regex, if you must. It’s\nonly broken code, not life and death.\n\nSo, why would someone deliberately choose the wrong tool? Laziness is, I think, a big factor.\nIgnorance and desperation are other reasons I could trivially understand. Steve gives art a free\npass—and he’s right. Sometimes, using the explicitly wrong tool makes a statement or teaches a\nlesson.\nBy “contextual requirements”, Steve likely meant that in some cases, a project might adopt a choice\nthat could be considered objectively inferior by externals, while still being the “correct” choice\nfor that specific team, given the constraints they are facing. And in a way, the same charity could\nbe extended to me using my pen knife as a pry bar to open a can of paint: there was no good\nalternative immediately available, therefore it was the right choice, because the alternative would\nhave been to not do something. As Teddy Roosevelt put it, “the next best thing is the wrong\nthing”.\nThere is a trait in toxic management to try and give everything a positive spin, and therefore we\nshouldn’t call out errors. Sometimes it’s because it’s not a business priority to fix that mistake,\nand therefore it’s easier to not call it a mistake at all. Other times, it’s because strong egos\ncan’t accept the egg-on-face effect of having suboptimal decisions attached to their legacy. This\noften happens with projects, and wanting to call projects a success, even if it ended up costing 5x\nmore than originally planned and was delivered 2 years behind schedule (of an original 12 month\nschedule). I still hope I’ll one day end up in a company that is able to call a project a failure,\nand learn from the mistakes, instead of insisting on calling it a success, and ingraining the\nmistakes as successful ways of doing something.\nThis mindset—that everything must be framed as an exclusive success—could actually be why some\nof these decisional blunders continue to be made. Instead of admitting that something didn’t work,\nwe double down on poor decisions.\nSo therefore, there’s an aspect of timing, or perspective: if you don’t know something is the wrong\ntool when you use it, then it isn’t the wrong tool in that moment. Hindsight might reveal that\nsomething was objectively the wrong tool. And context helps to explain or justify why a decision was\nmade, and how that decision might even make sense for a given team.\nBut we should still be able to label things as a bad choice when they are identified, even if the\nonly tangible benefit of doing so is to prevent making the same bad choice in the future.\nNow, I’d like to clarify something: I don’t believe Microsoft switching to Golang instead of\n$OTHER_LANG is a mistake in any way, shape or form. As I expressed previously, I\nthink it’s wonderful that Microsoft picked Golang, if and only if because this might finally curb\nthe current trend of pigeonholing programming languages into a singular purpose.\nBack in the day, Ruby gained insane popularity because it had an amazing development experience. TDD\ntools would happily flash at you in your terminal as you implemented features and completed your\nbacklog. The code was so expressive that what started as APIs became DSLs, and it was glorious.\nWriting Ruby put a smile on my face. Many languages still haven’t caught up to the absolutely\nincredible devex that was achieved, in a completely IDE-agnostic way.\nWe used Ruby for web, for configuration management, for package management, to manage virtual\nmachines, and to run exploits. And it was used for so many things exactly because of the devex.\nFish recently rewrote their codebase from C++ to Rust—not for performance, but for fun. That’s the\nenergy we need to bring back into programming. As Steve wrote:\n\nYou should write programs in the language you want to.\n\nOr to put it differently: trying to hammer in a nail using a screwdriver is a case of using the\nwrong tool for the job. Using a good programming language the team is comfortable and has fun with,\nisn’t.\n","description":"A quick reply to Steve Klabnik, about bias in tooling.","id":"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/reply-deliberate-wrong-tool/","path":"/blog/reply-deliberate-wrong-tool/","title":"Deliberately choosing the wrong tool"},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/reply-tim-stackoverflow-question/":{"body":"An old Maemo friend reached out on Twitter and asked for help regarding some issue he was\nrunning into using mysqli and PHP.

In this case, as you’ve already discovered, it’s\npossible to do it all in MySQL.\nBut first, let’s do part of what you forgot to do (and which is probably why you got downvoted a\nbit): let’s create a test MySQL table so we can run some queries on it:\n\nFrom your question, there’s 4 parts to the query you’re trying to write:\n\nyou only want uid = 101;\nyou only want fid = 10;\nyou want the 5 last items uploaded;\nyou only want the 5 first results.\n\n\nI’m not seeing limit misbehaving here, as long as the rest of the query does what it’s supposed to\ndo. A couple notes to keep in mind for the future, though:\nPlease don’t put integer values in quotes. In SQL (and most other languages), there’s no reason to\ndo so. You’re just asking the system to do more casting and whatnot. Secondly, try to do most work\nin MySQL, especially when it comes to filtering. Always try to reduce your dataset as much as\npossible in the first step. There are certain situations where it can be useful to do some filtering\non the client side, but those are micro-optimisations that really only come in very later.\nAnyway, now, let’s dig in to the rest of your question and more specifically, let’s try to figure\nout what was going wrong. If we run your original query directly in MySQL, we’ll notice that we get\ninteresting results:\n\nNotice that because of the order in which things appear in the table (due to the order by clause),\nthe last item actually has af_fid = 11.\nNow, if on the client side, we apply extra filtering as you’re doing with if ($row['af_fid']) == 10), it would only make sense that we end up with only 4 results.\nI’m not sure why you saw 3 results, but I’m going to warrant a guess and say that it was due to some\ndifferences in the code or data, compared to what you posted on SO. Conclusion: if you’d done all\nyour filtering in SQL from the get go, you most probably would’ve never hit this roadblock to start\nwith.\nFeel free to ping me if you have other questions.\n","description":"An old Maemo friend reached out on Twitter and asked for help regarding some\nissue he was running into using mysqli and PHP.

Advertising, bandwidth\nprices, the list is fairly long.  If this were a purely commercial war, end-users wouldn’t be hit.\nBut, neither Google nor Free wanting to back down, it stopped being a purely commercial war, and for\nthe past year or so, the pipe connecting Free users to YouTube’s servers has shrunk to become tiny.\nI don’t mind, I think Free is an excellent ISP, and even though I could switch to another ISP\nand bypass these issues, their stance on protecting my rights and privacy is unequalled. I value my\nprivacy and their company more than I value my YouTube bandwidth.\nI own a couple of dedicated servers with unlimited bandwidth (courtesy of OVH), so I decided to\ntry and use one of those as a proxy to YouTube. Here are the things you’ll need:\n\nA DNS server on your local network (I’ll be using dnsmasq on my raspberrypi).\nA server with squid3 on it.\n\nMy router is a Freebox Revolution, and by default the DHCP will give the router’s IP as DNS server.\nI changed the primary DNS to point to my raspberrypi, and kept the freebox’s IP as a secondary DNS,\nas backup, in case the raspberry is down.\nOn the raspberrypi, install dnsmasq:\n\nNext, configure dnsmasq to hijack all YouTube related traffic to your server:\n\nOn my server, I already host quite a few websites, so port 80 is already assigned to lighttpd. I\ncould use iptables to send the traffic from my home network to squid (on port 3128), but then I\ncouldn’t access sites hosted by lighty.\nInstead, I opted to use lighty as a reverse proxy onto squid, and added the following rule to\n/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf:\n\nAlso, don’t forget to add mod_proxy to the server.modules directive.\nNow, install squid:\n\nLastly, /etc/squid3/squid.conf needs a couple of lines for everything to work properly:\n\nAnd that’s it! Now, obviously, this completely and utterly breaks every SSL aspect on YouTube, but I\ndon’t care about those. Another side-effect is that when logging-in to another Google service such\nas GMail, one of the redirects that happens during the login process will fail. I imagine this is\nGoogle ensuring all the cookies are set properly. The workaround to this is to simply refresh the\npage you were trying to get at initially; the cookies will have been set, and you will be logged in.\n","description":"How to MITM YouTube to prevent peering issues.","id":"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/routing-youtube-server/","path":"/blog/routing-youtube-server/","title":"Routing YouTube traffic through a server"},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/rpm-versioning-jenkins/":{"body":"I’m currently deploying Jenkins at work, in order to simplify the build process. At the moment, we\nhave a fairly complicated process that involves a couple dozen steps, which, even though each step\nis fairly braindead, does require a good amount of focus and planning in order to get everything\njust right.\nJenkins provides a build number for all the different projects you might configure. Each build\nnumber is unique in a given project; this ensures that you can refer to specific builds without too\nmuch of a hassle. That’s great, but knowing that I’m trying to achieve fully automated RPM\npackaging, it doesn’t help me much.\nThe versioning system in our company (defined by moi, pretty much), is heavily inspired by the usual\nRPM rules: release numbers are reset to 1 whenever the version number changes. There’s no real way,\nas far as I know, to use Jenkins’ build number for this, as there is no programmatic way to reset\nthe build number in Jenkins.\nMulti-instance exclusive lock in Python\nThe first issue I tried to tackle was the fact that the Jenkins server will run multiple builds at\nthe same time, possibly for the same project. What this means is that simply having stuff in a file\nisn’t really sensible due to concurrency issues. I know that portalocker roughly does the same\nas what I tried to do, but not completely. portalocker provides a lock to a file; my implementation\nprovides a transaction-kinda lock, regardless of whether you want to access files or databases or\nwhatever.\nWithout further ado, here’s the class:\n\nThere’s a couple of TODOs, and I might push this stuff to my github account at some point or\nanother, but it gives a general idea on what I tried to do. The jist of it is that I use mkdir as an\natomic locking operation. What you lock against is basically just an identifier, which means that\nwhether you want to read/write to files, access a database, fiddle your toes doesn’t realy matter.\nIf the lock acquisition fails, the acquire() method will block until it is able to acquire the\nlock. If you don’t want it to block, there’s always nb_acquire() which will just return a boolean\nindicating the lock status.\nHow to use it\nHere’s how it could be used:\n\nAnd that’s really just it. The locking magic happens in the with statement. As soon you enter the\nwith statement, you are guaranteed to be the sole executor of whatever code you have running. As\nsoon as you leave the scope of the with statement, the lock is released. Below are a few other\nscenarios of how you could use the above class:\n\nSo, now we can execute a block of code without having to worry about other instances of the script\nmucking about our stuff. Let’s work on the RPM versioning now.\nEfficient RPM release numbers\nRPM versioning works like this: 1.2.3-4 where 1.2.3 is the version number, and 4 is the\nrelease. For a more in-depth overview of RPM versioning, check out Fedora’s wiki, or something. I\nusually put the version number of my software in a file somewhere, so getting that isn’t usually a\nproblem. However, the release part of the RPM version is a bit more tricky. The way we use it is\nthat every time we release something to the QA team (or directly to production if it’s a very urgent\nbugfix), we increment the release number if the version number hasn’t changed. This is the case, for\nexample, if you have to fix something in the packaging process, or if you are applying successive\nfixes to the release branch (according to nvie’s branching model).\nThis also means that as soon as the version number changes, the release number should be reset to 1.\nI wrote the following tool, which uses the Lock class above, to keep track of all the different\nreleases that have been built so far, based on the package name and version number:\n\nHow to use it\nThe tool is used as follows:\n\nFor example:\n\nSo, there we have it. A quick tool that keeps track of what release every package is supposed to\nhave, and stores it in an easy-to-maintain location (a JSON file in the user’s home directory). This\ntool is easily usable in Jenkins scripts, but that’ll be for a different blog entry.\n","description":"An approach to solve concurrent version bumping through CI","id":"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/rpm-versioning-jenkins/","path":"/blog/rpm-versioning-jenkins/","title":"RPM versioning with Jenkins"},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/scala-mac-2025/":{"body":"Scala is a functional programming language that I’ve come across in the past, but it\nnever stuck in my tool belt.

For the past twenty years I’ve\nbeen used to typing nearly as fast as I could think, or at the very least, talk. This previous\nsentence, however, took me well over a minute to write down. As I mentioned a few days ago, I have\ndecided to switch to a new keyboard layout. While the layout itself is still QWERTY, I am now using\nwhat is commonly referred to as a custom split ortholinear staggered-column mechanical keyboard.\n\nAs you can probably tell, this keyboard has significantly fewer keys than a typical one, and that’s\nsort of the point. This kind of keyboard layout is designed to try and reduce the amount of\nmovements your hand is making in order to reach all the keys on your keyboard.\nThe learning curve has been absolutely brutal. I was able to get a single time over 50 wpm, and that\nwas definitely a fluke. After a couple days of use, I am now consistently getting 30-40 wpm. I’m not\nconvinced attempting to write a lot during this transition phase is the greatest of ideas, but it\nseems to me like the only way out is to practice.\nInterestingly enough, one of the keys I struggle with the most is the c letter, which is tucked\nbelow the d key. This means that I should in theory use my middle finger in order to hit it, but on\nregular keyboards I seem to have taken the habit of using my index finger. The result is that nearly\nevery time I try to type c, I end up typing v. Even now, when I was consciously thinking through the\nprocess and explaining it.\nThe next section will be a bit more technical as I document things that were not immediately clear\nto me.\nHomerow mods\nBeyond the key layout difference, the biggest change is the use of homerow mods in order to access\nthe keys most people have around their boards. Most keyboards tend to come with a couple shift keys,\nsome control, alt and even super (Windows/Mac) keys. These don’t exist on a 36 key keyboard, so you\nhave to get creative.\nOne way the community has solved this is by inventing homerow mods. What it means is that the keys\non your homerow (e.g.: asdf-hjkl) have double duty. If I just tap ‘j’, I obviously get ‘j’. However\nif I hold ‘j’ for just a short while, it turns into a shift key. F does the same thing, just on the\nother side of the keyboard, in case there are collisions. The same is true for my control keys (d\nand k), alt (s and l) and super (a and ’).\nThis is a major shift (pun intended) in how I type, and have to think about typing.\nFirmware customisation\nThis keyboard is based on the nice!nano v2 microcontrollers. These provide wireless connectivity, so\nI am using the ZMK firmware (ZMK appears to be more geared towards wireless keyboards whereas\nQMK seems to be mostly wired). I decided to start with a layout based on the reasonably popular\nMiryoku layout. I talk about a layout, however I have decided to stick with QWERTY for\nnow. The layout, therefore, only refers to the different layers I have on the keyboard, and where\nkeys are positioned within those.\nThe first thing I wanted to do was adding combos, or chords I’ve grown quite used to over the past\nfew months. Here are the chords I want to achieve; all for Danish:\n\n‘o’ and ‘e’ to produce ‘ø’,\n‘a’ and ‘e’ to produce ‘æ’,\n‘a’ and ‘o’ to produce ‘å’.\n\nIn order to achieve this, I had to define some macros and combos in the firmware:\n\nThe full customisation can be found here (remember to include this file\notherwise it will have no effect). The most confusing thing in this was actually that the key\nnumbers did not line up with the physical keyboard I had in front of me. Because this\nchocofi keyboard is quite similar to a corne keyboard, that’s the layout that is\nused. Miryoku doesn’t use the extra keys on a corne anyway. The big difference is that the corne has\n42 keys whereas the chocofi only has 36. So instead of just being able to count the keys on the\nphysical object in front of me, I had to mentally remove some imaginary key numbers.\nSo what does this actually do? The combo says that if keys 3 and 9 are pressed simultaneously within\ncertain timeout, the macro should be invoked. The macro says that when it is invoked, it will\ngenerate a single key press of RA(O), which means right alt + O, which on my Mac, produces an ø.\nI suppose that this might be done without the use of a macro, just by using a combo alone, however I\nneed to add support for the uppercase form of these letters as well. I don’t expect that will be\ndoable without a macro.\nFor future reference, here is what the key mapping looks like on a chocofi for ZMK:\n\nAt the moment, I am focusing my attention on getting this keyboard to play nicely with my Mac only,\nand will add the complexity of other OS’ later on. On my current TODO list is fixing the layout as I\ndon’t currently have access to a tilde key, which is kind of important for me. I also need to\nimprove the 3D-printed case of the keyboard so that it sits in a more stable way on my desk. At the\nmoment it’s slightly janky and tends to tilt when I press some keys which is not entirely\ncomfortable. I might also need to work on the timing of some chording/tapping behaviour; I sometimes\ngenerate unwanted key presses when I start typing a bit faster, especially with some rolls such as\n‘st’.\nAnother comfort I’d like to get back somehow would be some form of caps lock. The main reason for\nthis is that with the homerow mods it can get a bit tiresome to switch from one hand to the other to\nmaintain shift when typing longer uppercase things (constants in Rust or other programming languages\ncome to mind). I know there’s support for this in ZMK, but I haven’t been able to figure out whether\nit’s already available in Miryoku.\nEdit: This turned out to be a non-issue. Miryoku has this built-in, and the reason I couldn’t find\nit is because I use the vi-shifted navigation layout. ZMK has a feature called caps\nwords which, when turned on, capitalises all letters until a non-alphanumerical\ncharacter is pressed. This luckily also includes underscores, so it’s a perfect fit for programming.\nOn Miryoku this is activated by pressing nav + /.\n","description":"Documenting my transition to custom split mechanical keyboards.","id":"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/switching-split-keyboard/","path":"/blog/switching-split-keyboard/","title":"Switching to a split keyboard"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.wedrop.it/":{"body":22,"description":0,"path":0,"title":2},"https://blog.wedrop.it/archive/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/bike-shed/":{"body":503,"description":7,"path":3,"title":2},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/boys-birthday-gift/":{"body":323,"description":8,"path":4,"title":3},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/breaking-the-ranks/":{"body":1963,"description":17,"path":3,"title":2},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/building-gcc/":{"body":86,"description":14,"path":3,"title":2},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/fedora-21-vpn-problems/":{"body":131,"description":19,"path":5,"title":4},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/fedora-22-wifi-problems/":{"body":142,"description":7,"path":5,"title":4},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/freebox-rutorrent/":{"body":280,"description":11,"path":3,"title":4},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/freebsd-setup/":{"body":249,"description":4,"path":3,"title":2},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/fresh-coat-of-paint/":{"body":211,"description":16,"path":4,"title":3},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/fresh-coat-paint-part-deux/":{"body":209,"description":5,"path":6,"title":5},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/hash-anagram-challenge-part-1/":{"body":448,"description":6,"path":6,"title":5},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/hash-anagram-challenge-part-2/":{"body":651,"description":7,"path":6,"title":5},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/reply-deliberate-wrong-tool/":{"body":623,"description":6,"path":5,"title":4},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/reply-tim-stackoverflow-question/":{"body":227,"description":22,"path":5,"title":4},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/routing-youtube-server/":{"body":226,"description":5,"path":4,"title":5},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/rpm-versioning-jenkins/":{"body":392,"description":7,"path":4,"title":3},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/scala-mac-2025/":{"body":153,"description":6,"path":4,"title":5},"https://blog.wedrop.it/blog/switching-split-keyboard/":{"body":578,"description":6,"path":4,"title":3}},"length":21},"lang":"English"}
